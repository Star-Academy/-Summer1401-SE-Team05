I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.

The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.

It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.

Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!

Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.

I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don-t know if it wrap up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.
